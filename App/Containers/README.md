### Containers Folder
A container is what they call a "Smart Component".

Also located in here are 2 special containers: `App.js` and `RootContainer.js`.

`App.js` is first component loaded after `index.js`

`RootContainer.js` is the first visual component in the app.  It is the ancestor of all other screens and components.

You'll probably find you'll have great mileage in Ignite apps without even touching these 2 files.  They, of course, belong to you, so when you're ready to add something non-visual like Firebase or something visual like an overlay, you have spots to place these additions.
